        <p>Customer satisfaction is very important to us so we welcome  feedback both positive and negative.  The  positive feedback makes us feel good while the negative guides us in improving  everyone's holiday experience.  We are  delighted to say that the feedback we receive is overwhelmingly positive and  here are some of the reviews from happy Shannon Boating customers:<br>
          A  big shout out to Rob at Shannon Boating who once again sourced the best boating  experience at excellent value.  Even  though this is our third holiday on the Shannon organised by Rob we know we  will be back as there is so much more to experience.<br>
          Joe  Smith, Co. Meath, Ireland<br>
          We  had a most enjoyable fun filled holiday and cannot recommend your company and  its serviced highly enough.<br>
          Nick  Dollery, Co. Cork, Ireland<br>
          We  had a great time on our trip from Carrick-on-Shannon to Banaher.  Our boat from Silver Line suited us to  perfection and even as first time boaters we managed the large boat with a  little help from the bow and stern thrusters.   The Captain's Book was essential with easy to follow navigation tips and  instructions.  Thank you Shannon Boating  for all your assistance and guidance.<br>
          Kirby  Stanton, Texas, U.S.A.<br>
          This  is our second time booking our cruise on the Shannon with Shannon Boating and  the fact that we had problems with the boat has highlighted for us the service  provided by your company.  On the second  night of our seven day cruise we had a problem with the bilge pump which was  running continuously.  We contacted  Shannon Boating's helpline at 10pm and they organised an engineer to come out  immediately, the problem could not be solved so the following morning we were  supplied with a replacement boat (which was bigger and better) at no extra  charge.  The weather was fabulous so everyone  continued on the holiday in high spirits.   It is good to know that when things go wrong, as they do, then Shannon  Boating is a one stop shop for all our needs.   I will definitely recommend your company for boating on the Shannon.<br>
          Sean  Neville, Co. Donegal, Ireland<br>
          First  time on the Shannon and we had a great time.   The boat from Carrick Craft was perfect and while the weather was not  quite perfect we still had so much to do on our trip that it all passed far too  quickly.  Your recommendation to use the  week cruising from Portumna to Carrick-on-Shannon one way turned out to be the  best advice as we were able to take our time and see lots.<br>
          Rory  McNamara, Co. Kerry, Ireland<br>
          We  had a great time fishing on the Shannon and its tributaries.  The ten day trip, planned by your company,  ensured that we not only got to fish in various locations but the accommodation  was perfect and the packed lunches each day ensured that we got the most from  every day.<br>
          M.  Schmidt, Germany.<br>
          Our  week on the Shannon was one of the best trips my family has taken, we are  converted and fully intent booking next year's trip with Shannon Boating.  From start to finish everything was wonderful  including the weather!!  I can't  recommend your company highly enough for your helpful and friendly advice. The  teenagers were thrilled to try out the kayaks on the Blueways along the way and  each day was a new adventure for them also.   This was our first time on the Shannon and we discovered parts of  Ireland that we never knew existed.  Navigating  was challenging at times but we soon got the hang of keeping between the  markers and away from any dangers!  Your  advice and tips on map reading on the river were invaluable.   We will be back to experience more of  Ireland's longest river and will definitely be in touch with Shannon Boating in  the near future.<br>

		<h1 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	
		<h2>How do I choose which boat?</h2>
        <p>The boat you choose depends on how many people you have  coming with you on your holiday.  The  largest boats on the Shannon sleep up to twelve and the smallest will sleep up  to four.  The larger the boat naturally  the bigger the price.  Just be aware that  the bed number will include a bed made by converting the kitchen table and also  from the seating area of the boat.  Also,  tall people need to be aware that some of the beds can be a bit on the short  side.  Each boat will have a layout plan  showing all the sleeping accommodation on board.  My advice would be to always choose a boat  suitable for two people more than your party, it makes for more comfort all  around.</p>
        <h2>How much will the holiday cost?</h2>
        <p>The cost of the holiday will depend mostly on the boat you  choose, the duration of your holiday and the number of hours boating (fuel  costs) you wish to do.  Hire companies  have boats of all sizes and also of all ages and the bigger and newer the boat  the more expensive it will be.  The time  of the year makes a big difference too and the most expensive months are July  and August, the lease expensive time being March and October.  </p>
        <h2>What is provided on board?</h2>
        <p>All boats have at least one bathroom with shower, a galley  with a cooker, oven and a small fridge.   Some will have microwave ovens, low voltage appliances and 12v sockets.  Everything needed to live on board is  provided including fresh bedding, towels, soap, toilet paper, cutlery and  crockery.  Most boats also have a torch  and binoculars on board.  Some of the  larger boats have bow or stern thrusters.   Some of the newer boats have shore power and new shore power points are  being added continuously by Waterways Ireland, a list of these are available on  their website.  Link? </p>
        <h2>Do I need a licence or experience?</h2>
        <p>No licence or experience is required to hire a boat on the  Shannon as full tuition is provided on arrival at the hire base.  Driving a boat takes a little practice as the  boats do not react the same way or as quickly as a car.  You will be shown all the tricks of  manoeuvring a boat by the staff who are only too happy to help you get it right  and they also provide a manual with maps and hints.</p>
        <h2>Is there a minimum age to hire a cruiser?</h2>
        <p>Yes the minimum age to hire a cruiser is 21.</p>
        <h2>Is it possible to hire a boat for less than a week?</h2>
        <p>It is possible to hire a boat for a period of three or four  nights depending on availability.  Most  companies facilitate this except in the months of July and August.  </p>
        <h2>What are the payment terms?</h2>
        <p>To confirm the booking you will need to pay 33% of the boat  hire fee and the balance is paid six weeks before the cruise is due to  begin.  For the shorter breaks the full  hire fee is required when confirming the booking.  At Shannon Boating we take payment by credit  card online or by phone or by  any of the payment options listed.   Payment can be made online and our banking details are available on our  booking form.</p>
        <h2>Are the boats insured?</h2>
        <p>The boats are fully insured against damage with an excess on  each boat equal to the refundable damage deposit, which can vary from €850 to  €3,200 depending on the boat.  This is  paid directly to the hire boat company when you arrive and is fully refundable  when the boat is returned undamaged.   More options on boat insurance is listed with each boat such as a damage  waiver.</p>
        <h2>Any hidden costs?</h2>
        <p>Like with hiring a car, the fuel tanks on the boat will be  full when you get the boat.  Depending on  how fast you drive the boat and how many hours boating you do you might only  have to get the tank filled on your return and the fuel costs calculated.  If you are undertaking a longer cruise there  are diesel filling stations at all the main tie up areas.  Most of the boats have a maximum speed of  around 10-15Kph which helps with the fuel costs!</p>
        <h2>Are life jackets and safety equipment provided?</h2>
        <p>Life jackets are provided for all crew members and will be  sized by the hire boat staff.  Fire  extinguishers and fire blankets are on board as well as a first aid kit and flare  gun for emergencies.  </p>
        <h2>What do I need to take with me?</h2>
        <p>You will have to provide your own food and drinks and the  hire companies will be happy to organise your groceries delivered to your boat  at your request.  Extra towels and rain  gear are always a good idea when boating and rubber soled shoes for grip on the  deck are helpful.  </p>
        <h2>Is there heating on the boat?</h2>
        <p>All of the boats have warm air central heating that runs on  its own motor and does not require the engine to be running.  You will need to run the main engine for hot  water.  </p>
        <h2>Do I have to pay to moor the boat?</h2>
        <p>There is free mooring at every town and village on the  length of the Shannon and Erne waterways.   At busy times it is acceptable to moor alongside another boat if there  is no free space.  There are some private  marinas, like in Athlone, where there is a charge for mooring. </p>
        <h2>What about locks?</h2>
        <p>Locks on the River Shannon are operated by lock keepers at a  cost of €1.30 per use (since Covid this fee has been waived but could be  re-instated at any time).  The opening  hours for the locks vary from season to season and will be highlighted in the  Captain's book which will be on board.   There are 16 locks on the Shannon Erne Waterway which are all automatic  and you will need a swipe card to use these locks.  Swipe cards are available from the hire boat  company as well as from many shops along the waterway.  These swipe cards are also used for shower  and laundry facilities at various harbours.   Your cruise company will supply information on how to operate the  automatic locks and the instructions are also at each lock.  Please allow plenty of time for passage  through the locks as a number of boats may be going through together and this  takes time.<br>
          Portumna Bridge opens on a fixed schedule and the times are also contained in  the Captain's book and again vary per season.  </p>
        <h2>What is the collection and return time for the boat?</h2>
        <p>The collection time for the boat is 4pm which allows time  for the boat to be cleaned and maintained after the previous hire.  It may be possible to get the boats for short  breaks out around 2pm unless the marina is very busy.  The boat should be returned and vacated by  10am on the final morning.  </p>
        <h2>How do I get to the marina?</h2>
        <p>Most of the companies provide a transfer service from the  airports to their marinas as the marinas are mostly in rural areas and  difficult to reach by public transport.   Shared transfers can be arranged where possible.  The prices for transfers are available on  each company's page.  We would be happy  to quote for a private transfer when you are booking your boat or can help you  with combining public transport and private transfers if you wish.  </p>
        <h2>Is there somewhere to park my car?</h2>
        <p>There is free car parking at all of the marinas in Ireland  with the exception of the Emerald Star marinas who charge €6.00 per night.  This parking is not supervised at night but  the crime rate is very low in rural Ireland and we have not yet heard of a car  being interfered with at any marina on the river.</p>
        <h2>Can I take a pet on board?</h2>
        <p>Yes pets can be brought on board at your own risk and will  incur an extra cleaning charge of between €60-€80.   </p>
