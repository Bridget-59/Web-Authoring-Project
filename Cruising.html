<h1>Cruising the Shannon</h1>
		<h1 align="center">Cruising times and Suggested Cruises</h1>
        <p>One of the most important things to keep in mind when  planning your boating holiday on the River Shannon is the time it takes to get  from town to town keeping in mind the time spent passing through locks and  under bridges.  A cruise on the Shannon  is all about relaxation.  The boats go  very slowly, you will be overtaken by cyclists and even joggers if they are  fast enough, so relax and watch the beautiful scenery go by.  The chart below shows the average cruising  times between towns on the River Shannon in hours.  If you are heading upriver to the north read  horizontally and if you are heading south read vertically.  Keep in mind also that we can arrange one way  hire with hire companies who have two or more hire bases and this will give you  more time to explore everything the river and its lakes have to offer or indeed  more time to relax and go slowly!</p>
