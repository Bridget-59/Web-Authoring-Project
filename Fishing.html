<h2>What you need to know</h2>
		  <p>Ireland is recognised as being an outstanding fishing  holiday destination in Europe with vast variety and quality of fish.  The Irish climate is well suited to sport  angling.  The warm waters of the North  Atlantic Drift lap the south and west coasts giving Ireland a milder climate  than its geographical location would indicate.   The result is a fabulous mixture of cold and warm water fish species  capable of exciting the specialist or casual angler on holidays.</p>
			
		  <p>Fishing Ireland is a resource of Inland Fisheries Ireland  who have statutory responsibility of Ireland's rivers and streams.  They also have information on fishing venues  on the River Shannon which are suitable for anglers who have a disability or  restricted mobility.  Everything you need to know about the regulations regarding  fishing in Ireland is available on the website as well as helpful information  of where to fish for particular fish.   (Fishing Ireland, 2023)</p>
			
			<h2>Licence to fish</h2>
		  <p>In the Republic of Ireland a State Licence is required to  fish for both salmon and sea trout.  You  usually need to buy a local permit in addition to your State Licence before  fishing.  When fishing for trout, pike and coarse  fishing, a licence is not required but you may need to purchase a local  permit.  Getting your licence from the tackle shops is  a good idea as they will know if you need to purchase a local permit also.</p>  

		  <p>In Norther Ireland you will need a licence for all  freshwater fishing.  A list of fishing  tackle shops where licences may be bought is available on the Fishing Ireland  web site or you can buy a licence online from their site also.</p> 

		<h2>Location location location</h2>
		  <p>Angling on Lough Derg requires local club membership  available at the local tackle shops.   Killaloe is a good centre for trout and coarse fishing with trout particularly  good in May and autumn.  The Nenagh River  flows into Lough Derg at Dromineer and is a major trout fishery with trout of  up to 2lg in the wider stretches.</p>
		  <p>The River Suck runs deep and slow providing excellent coarse  fishing with large shoals of bream and rudd.   The river at Clonmacnoise has some clear banks for easy fishing and  fishes well for bream, roach and tench.   In previous years the power stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro used  to be an anglers dream due to the hot water giving rise to big shoals of bream,  hybrids, roach, rudd and tench but both stations were recently closed and while  the fishing is still good it is not what it used to be.</p>
		  <p>There is some salmon to be caught in the Shannon and Lough  Ree and both also fish well for trout especially in late May and early June but  remember you need a licence to fish for these fish.</p>
		  
		<p>Lough Allen draws fishermen from around the world as it is  famous for trout and pike fishing.  Again  there is quite a lot of information about fishing in this area on the Fishing  Ireland website which gives information on access to open shore fishing spots.</p>
		  <p>Fishing on the  Shannon-Erne Waterway is especially good on the Garadice Lake as it is one of  Ireland's premier waters.  Its 1200 acres  hold rich stock of roach, hybrids and rudd with some quality perch and  pike.  Garadice and surrounding areas  include pegs at Haughtons Shore which will accommodate up to 30 anglers.   
		  Ballyconnell is well known as a coarse fishing centre.</p>
