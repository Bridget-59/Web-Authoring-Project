		<h2>Cruising the Lower Shannon/Lough Derg</h2>
        <p>The southern limit for hire cruising on the Shannon River is  the historical town of Killaloe at the southern tip of Lough Derg which has  hotels, restaurants and shops. <br>
          Lough Derg is probably the most picturesque lake on the  Shannon with rolling hills surrounding the lake.  There are many historical sites around Lough  Derg including Brian Boru&rsquo;s Fort just north of Killaloe on the banks of the Shannon  which dates back to 1002 AD and Holy Island, the site of a monastery founded by St.  Column around 520 AD.  This can be  reached by anchoring off the island and approaching in a smaller boat or there  are also boat trips available from the nearby town of Mountshannon.   <br>
          It is about 5 hours boating from the Emerald Star boat hire  base in Portumna on the northern tip of Lough Derg.  There is also a base at Banagher a couple of  hours cruising north of the lake where Silver Line and Carrick Craft hire from.  There are charming villages and towns all  around the coast of the Lough Derg with great restaurants and pubs.  Portumna itself has a large forest park and  Portumna Castle is well worth a visit.  Terryglass,  an hours cruising from Portumna, is a charming village with two pubs that do  excellent food.  Stop off at Kilgarvin,  a tiny village on the shores of Lough Derg, and a 20 minute walk from the quay  will bring you to the village of Ballinderry which has good pubs and a  shop.  Dromineer is a popular spot  for boats of all kinds and for water sports enthusiasts. The quay is well  equipped with developed piers and a children&rsquo;s playground. Mountshannon is  the village where the mountains of Sleive Aughty meet Lough Derg, providing fabulous  views of the Tidy Towns award winning village. Scarriff, a small village on  the River Scarriff which is renowned for quality angling.  If you hire a boat from the Banagher base it  will take approx. 7 hours cruising south to Killaloe.  <br>
          Heading north from Banagher and cruising for two hours you  will reach Shannonbridge named after the bridge built in 1757.  The remains of the Napoleonic fortifications  at Shannonbridge are considered to be a unique example of fortifications of the  period and was completed in 1817.  There  are shops, restaurants and pubs here.  Ballinasloe which  is built on the River Suck is just a short cruise from Shannonbridge and has a  newly built marina.  Ballinasloe is  famous for hosting one of the oldest horse fairs in Europe which can be traced  back to the early eighteenth century.   Napoleons mount at the battle of Waterloo was bought here! If you prefer  not to detour from the River Shannon just one hours cruising will bring you to  Clonmacnoise.  The ancient monastic  settlement at Clonmacnoise is one of its kind in Europe.  Built by St. Kieran in about 545 AD the abbey  grew to become one of the great monastic cities of early Europe.  There are many crosses and towers still  standing at this site and can be seen from afar as you meander along the river.  There is an interpretive centre in Clonmacnoise that draws about 100,000  visitors every year.  </p>
        <h2>Cruising the Upper Shannon/Lough Ree</h2>
        <p>Two hours of gentle cruising will bring you to Athlone,  one of the biggest towns on the Shannon, and is deemed to be in the centre of  Ireland at the foot of Lough Ree. Athlone Castle was originally built in 1210  by the Normans on the site of an old wooden fort.  Since then the castle has been attacked and  damaged many times leading to much rebuilding and remodelling. The castle now  houses an interpretive centre, tourist office, gallery, museum and tea  rooms.   Athlone offers a wide variety of hotels,  restaurants, pubs and shops as well as some lovely river walkways.  Glasson is a beautiful village about an hour&rsquo;s  cruise from Athlone and hosts a wealth of activities including award winning  restaurants and a championship golf course.   Lough Ree Cruisers have a base in Glasson which is also an excellent  base from which to head north.  A little  further from Glasson is a well-known restaurant/hotel, The Wineport, and boats can  tie up here for free overnight if they visit the restaurant.  Well worth a visit both for the food and the  view out over the inner lake and across to the golf club.  Across the bottom of the lake from here is Hodson Bay where  you can moor your boat while you eat and drink in the Hodson Bay Hotel. There  are also lots of water activities here for the younger crew members.  Other harbours that you can moor at as you  make your way up Lough Ree are Portrunny and Lecarrow, both quiet scenic places to relax  in.  Cruising from Athlone to the top of  Lough Ree directly takes about 2.5 hours.   Lanesboro/Ballyleague straddles the Shannon at the norther tip of  the lake with Ballyleague on the western side in Roscommon and Lanesboro on the  eastern side in Longford.  There is ample  moorings here both above and below the bridge and shops, restaurants and  bars.  There is also a whiskey distillery  in the town of Lanesboro and the staff are happy to show you around and let you  sample the different whiskeys.  Before  getting to the next town, Tarmonbarry, there is a lock to be entered.  There is quite a large change of water levels  here so be ready for the lock-keeper using an extra-long hook to get your  ropes. You will then be raised up in the lock where you have the choice of  staying along the canal edge or continuing on up under the bridge (which the  lock-keeper will open) to head for the next town, Rooskey.  You can also turn off for Clondra  which is where the Royal Canal joins the River Shannon.  There are two good restaurants in Tarmonbarry  and it is a nice spot to spend a night.   Clondra is a lovely tranquil place to tie up for the night but places  are limited as it is very popular with kayaking and walking enthusiasts.  Rooskey has a small lock and a good  supermarket right on the waterway and there are some lovely moorings along the  river between the lock and the village.  Dromod  is less than an hour by boat from Rooskey and has a picturesque harbour on Lough Bofin.  There are good quality restaurants in the  nearby village. Cruising north from Dromod for an hour brings you to the Albert  Lock and Jamestown Canal.  The lock is  bigger than Rooskey but not as big as Tarmonbarry and brings you out onto the  canal which is a lovely tree lined tranquil space, as with all canals the speed  is restricted so it is a time to relax as you head towards Carrick-on-Shannon.  This is an important crossing point on the  river since ancient times.  In 1684 George  St. George, a local landlord, was granted the rights to the tolls for the  bridge over the river.  In 1718 a new  bridge with seventeen arches was built which was later replaced by the Shannon  Commission in the eighteen forties.   There is a large marina here where hire companies Carrick Craft, Emerald  Star and Locaboat are based.  There is  also ample mooring for private boats.   Carrick-on-Shannon has some lovely walks along the river and plenty of  shops, restaurants and bars but be aware that it is also very popular with stag  and hen parties and can be very busy at the weekends. <br>
          There are a few different destinations going further north from  Carrick-on-Shannon, you can head to Lough Key via the Boyle River or head for Leitrim Village  known as the gateway to the Shannon-Erne Waterway. Smaller crafts can be  hired from Leitrim Quay or Carrick Day Boats and can navigate the Lough Allen  Canal to Drumshambo  where Ireland&rsquo;s first floating boardwalk is.   Most hire cruisers are too large to navigate the canal due to its  narrowness and the locks too small.  In  Drunshambo the 600m boardwalk is the start of a 6.5 linear walking and cycling  trail along the Shannon Blueway from Acres Lake to Battlebridge Lock near  Leitrim Village.  Lough Allen which can  be reached by way of Drumshambo lock is surrounded by Sliabh an Iarainn and the  Arigna Mountains is the uppermost of the three main lakes on the River  Shannon.  Lough Allen and the surrounding  coniferous wooded area is also an important bird habitat, providing sheltered  nesting sites in the undergrowth and plenty of feeding areas.  Red-breasted Merganser, Common Sandpiper, jay,  heron, redpoll, crossbill and curlew are just some examples of the rich bird  community at Lough Allen.  (Ask about Ireland, 2023) <br>
          Cootehall  is a small village located at the entrance of the Boyle River on the way up to  Lough Key.  There is good mooring at the  bridge here with a waterfront restaurant.   Lough Key Forest Park is about 3 hours cruising up the Boyle River.  A lovely spin passing a golf course  overlooking Lough Eidin (one of many small lakes along the Shannon) and under  Knockvicar bridge, on through lock Clarendon Lock into Lough Key. Lough Key  Forest Park is well worth a visit with plenty moorings and on shore electric  points.  Here you can try the Boda Borg  experience, zip-lining, tree top walk, segways, electric bike trails and many  many woodland walks. There is a Lakeside Café in the visitor centre and food  trucks for a fuss free picnic. (Lough Key, 2023)   A short cruise on up the River Boyle brings  you to a small harbour from which you can walk to the town of Boyle.  Here you can enquire about stand up paddle boarding, the wellness and fitness  water sport that has taken the world by storm.   It is also a great way to explore the water ways of Lough Key!    </p>
        <h2>Cruising the Shannon-Erne Waterway/Lough Erne</h2>
        <p>The Shannon-Erne Waterway was known as the Ballinamore and  Ballyconnell Canal and opened in 1860.   The canalised river that leads from the River Shannon at Leitrim village  to the Erne River at Belturbet was originally built as a famine project  between 1845 and 1860.  The project was a  failure in the 19th century but it was restored and reopened in 1994.  It is 63km of river, lake and still water  canal starting in Leitrim village and ending in Belturbet.  During the excavation a beautiful piece of  art dating from the first centaury was discovered, the Keshcarrigan Bowl, it is  now in the National Museum of Ireland.   It  takes approximately 13 hours to travel as there are 16 automated locks along  the waterway and a speed limit of 5kph to protect the canal banks.  The waterway is mostly tranquil as it  meanders along with some five small towns along the way, each with pubs and  restaurants. Keshcarrigan is a small scenic village surrounded by lakes with  good fishing and with excellent mooring facilities and is always good for a night  of Irish hospitality.  Ballinamore  means &ldquo;Mouth of the big ford&rdquo; as it was the main crossing point on the Yellow  river, now known as the Shannon-Erne waterway.   The bridge at Ballyconnell must be approached with caution due to  strong currents or high water levels.   Keep to the centre of the bridge arch as you drive through and if in  doubt about your height please check with us.   If you are feeling like some exercise the Slieve Russell  rises to 406m above the town of Ballyconnell and there are breath taking views  of the surrounding areas from the top. The 17th century Church of  Ireland is surrounded by earthen fortifications and there are two diamond  shaped redoubts dating from the war between James 11 and William of Orange in  1689.  Belturbet today is a relaxed  market town situated on the east bank of the river Erne. Historically the town  charter allowed the local authorities to enact their own bye-laws and one of  these laws stated that no Catholics was allowed inside the town after  sunset.  It is said that any Catholic  found breaking this law was brought to the &ldquo;Ducking Stool&rdquo; at the river and  ducked repeatedly until they agreed to never again break the law.  The ducking stool&rsquo;s real purpose was to load  coal from carts onto barges for transport on the river.  There are plenty mooring points here and lots  of facilities in the town.  From Belturbet  you can cruise north along the Erne river to Lough Erne.  Take care in windy weather as the lake is  known to get choppy in high winds. Upper Lough Erne (which strangely is to the  south of Lower Lough Erne) features the county town of Enniskillen, the largest town  in county Fermanagh.  It is built on a  natural island about halfway between upper and lower Lough Erne.  There is moorings right beside the Erneside  Shopping Centre where you can get practically everything you need.  Enniskillen Castle was built in the 15th  century by the Maguires and now houses the Fermanagh County Museum and a  heritage centre.  The most striking  feature of the castle is the Watergate, two turrets which were added to the  castle to dominate the water approach to the castle.  Carrick Craft and Locaboat have hire bases  here and one way hire trips can be arranged giving you more time to see all the  many sights.  Aghinver Boat Company and  Manor House Marine also have hire bases on Lough Erne.  Devenish Island to the north is one of the  most important monastic sites in Ireland.   The monastery was originally founded by St. Molaise in the sixth century  but most of the ruins date from the twelfth century.  There is a surviving round tower which stands  eight one feet and has a cornice carved with four human heads.  Kesh is a beautiful village located on the  shores of Lough Erne and is a very popular holiday spot. The village is close  to the Janus figures on Boa Island which are thought to be pre-Christian  sculptures.  Also nearby is White Island  which has ruins of a 12th century church containing six stone carved  figures believed to be St. Patrick, St. Columcille, King Leary and his son  Enna.  Of the remaining two figures one  is believed to be Sheela-na-gig, a female fertility figure.  Belleek is famous for its pottery and has  many craft workshops where the works of local artisans may be viewed and  purchased.  The area is steeped in  history with sites dating from early pagan times to castles and forts from  early Christian through to the present day.   There are many areas of breath-taking scenery to visit around Belleek  such as Knather wood and Breezy Mountain.   In 1866 1.2 million tons of rock was blasted from Belleek falls and the  river has undergone great changes as it was adapted for river transport and  power generation.  The introduction of  sluice gates at the pottery allowed river craft to travel from Belleek to Cavan  and goods from surrounding areas were brought to Belleek for river and lake  transport.      </p>
